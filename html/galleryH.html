			First plane ride and first out of the country. First step out of the plane was already nerve wracking. People were too friendly for a Filipino but, they're nice. They would smile at you and even say thank you for a small thing. Hawaii is where I had fireworks for the first time on a NYE. <br><br>

			3 weeks of stay then I had to go back to PH for school. Summer 2019, I went back to stay there for 2 months.
			
			<br> <br> I went to North Shore, where big waves and famous shimp trucks are. They also had the best shave ice in the island, which is Matsumoto's Shave Ice. People lined up for these. <br> <br>

			I was also able to visit the famous Waikiki beach and all the other places around Waikiki: Royal Hawaiian Palace, Kakaako Murals, Kapiolani Park, Hilton Village, etc.. In terms of Food, it was 10/10 but since I am not of a big eater and they serve big servings, I wasn't able to eat almost all of the things I've ordered. <br> <br>

			First week of July, I flew to Maui to spend my 4th of July there. Stayed at Sands of Kahana for the beach view in the morning, had fun in their Sports Park and had my Luau at Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa. I went back to Oahu after a week.

			For my last few weeks there, I explored the other famous tourist spots like the Byodo-in Temple, Dole Plantation, Tantalus Lookout, etc.. The country and the people was welcoming, I didn't have any problem adjusting. It would be nice to go back there again.
