			As someone who lived in one place for 18 years, Baguio was hard to live in at first. One, I'm away from my family for the first time. Two, weather is so much different compared to my home. Three, I live in a dorm. <br> <br>

			Why Baguio? It's where I study. I'm a Computer Science student in UP Baguio. Adjusting to a new school and new set of people with different cultures who came from different places was harder than when it was in Hawaii. Had to go out of my way to be friends with my blocmates whom I'm gonna spend my entire college life with. It was a good thing that I easily got along with them and eversince, we started planning on going out and eating together at lunch. <br><br>

			During our free time or on weekends, we would revisit places we've been to before college or explore new places. Burnham Park, Night Market, Session Road, and Camp John Hay are just few of the places we visited. Included in the pictures are places in our university where we usually go. <br><br>

			I've also attended few events in Baguio City that made my first year fun and meaningful, making it my second home. People are nice, welcoming, and accepting.
